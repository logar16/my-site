      <Section>
        This degree was an awesome opportunity to learn new things and stretch myself. 
        I worked full-time while working on this degree part-time, and it was not easy.
        It changed my mind about several things related to technology and inspired me as to what I want out of a career.
        Below are some specific skills I learned, organized by course.
      </Section>
      <Section  title='Deep Learning' id='DL'>
        In this class, I learned about automatic differentiation, the nuances of gradient descent (e.g. vanishing gradients),
        and modern applications of deep neural networks in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning domains.
        I hand-crafted my own forward and backward passes for linear and convolutional layers (and their loss functions).
        Through this, I gained greater appreciation for the difficulties of deep learning as well as became aware of many more interesting applications of the technology.
        This class exposed me to <b>PyTorch</b>, a neural network library that I now greatly enjoy.
        Along with lectures from a quality professor, I received instruction from ML researchers at Facebook applying DL in the real world.
        For <a  href="https://github.gatech.edu/ljones91/cs7643-project" target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>the final project</a>, 
        I worked with a team to train and analyze multi-agent Reinforcement Learning models trained with limited observations and the addition of memory.
        This was done using the Unity ML-Agents Soccer-Twos environment and the ML-Agents training code (with some modifications).
      </Section>
      <Section  title='Machine Learning'  id='ML'>
        This course included a broad survey of Machine Learning techniques.  I covered traditional classification methods such as decision trees or k-means.
        I also learned about many new and interesting methods such as neural networks, support vector machines, and expectation maximization.
        Assignments included gathering data, training multiple models, and evaluating and comparing their performance in multiple areas.
        I used the <b>SciPy</b> and <b>NumPy</b> libraries extensively.
      </Section>
      <Section title='Reinforcement Learning' id='RL'>
        Perhaps my favorite course at Georgia Tech, I learned about the Bellman Equation, Value and Policy Iteration, Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Game Theory (for multi-agent environments).
        The most interesting project was replicating the DQN algorithm initially proposed by DeepMind to solve the OpenAI "Lunar Lander" environment.
        At the time, I did the project with Keras, but later (after the Deep Learning class), I converted it to use <b>PyTorch</b> (see <a href='#/projects'>Projects</a>).
        The project forced me to really dive into RL with neural networks as state approximators, which I have embraced wholeheartedly.
        I also learned how to create an efficient setup for testing and evaluation so that exploration of models and hyperparameters can be done quickly and efficiently.
